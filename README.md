Reflection

This task helped me understand how GitHub repositories work and how to push files online.  
At first, GitHub Pages was confusing because the live link did not appear immediately.  
I learned how commits track changes step by step.  
Creating multiple commits helped me understand version control better.  
I now know how to publish a simple website using GitHub Pages.
